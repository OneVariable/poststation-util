# Getting Started Tutorial

This tutorial will show you how to use Poststation and the parts you'll
use as a developer.

This tutorial is broken up into two main stages:

The first stage uses [simulated devices][Using Simulated Devices] to get
familiar with the poststation application and tools.

The second stage uses a [Raspberry Pi 2040][Using an RP2040] as a connected
device, as you typically would for connected USB devices.

[Using Simulated Devices]: ./100-simulator.md
[Using an RP2040]: ./200-rp2040.md
