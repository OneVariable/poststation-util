# The poststation-sdk crate

For this next section, we'll use the SDK library, `poststation-sdk`. The source for `poststation-sdk` can be found
[on GitHub](https://github.com/OneVariable/poststation-util).

Make sure that:

1. You have installed Rustm using the instructions at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
2. Your poststation server **is still running** with a simulator device, on the current machine

## Create a new binary application project

We'll create a new application for interacting with our devices. We typically refer to these as "host" applications,
as they are running on our desktop "hosted" environment.

We'll need to create a new project, and add our basic dependencies.

```sh
$ cargo new --bin sdk-example
    Creating binary (application) `sdk-example` package
note: see more `Cargo.toml` keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

$ cd sdk-example
$ cargo add tokio --features=macros,rt-multi-thread,time
    Updating crates.io index
      Adding tokio v1.43.0 to dependencies
...
$ cargo add poststation-sdk
    Updating crates.io index
      Adding poststation-sdk v0.4.0 to dependencies
...
$ cargo add serde_json
    Updating crates.io index
      Adding serde_json v1.0.138 to dependencies
...
```

We can then add the following content into the `src/main.rs` file:

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Connect to the poststation server running locally.
    // defaults to secure connection settings
    let client = poststation_sdk::connect("127.0.0.1:51837").await.unwrap();

    // Obtain a list of connected devices, similar to
    // `poststation-cli ls`
    let devices = client.get_devices().await.unwrap();
    for device in devices.iter() {
        println!(
            "serial: {:016X} name: {:>10}, connected?: {}",
            device.serial, device.name, device.is_connected,
        );
    }
}
```

And run our new application:

```sh
$ cargo run --release
...
   Compiling sdk-example v0.1.0 (/private/tmp/sdk-example)
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 9.86s
     Running `target/release/sdk-example`
serial: 27927AE08C5C829B name:  DIXIE-201, connected?: false
serial: 3588A006538528CC name: YOGURT-150, connected?: false
serial: 563BF78B6A56DF04 name: QUIRKY-344, connected?: false
```

## Check the docs!

For a more in-depth overview of all of the features offered by the SDK crate, check out the
[documentation hosted on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/poststation-sdk/latest/poststation_sdk).

You can also look at the source of the `poststation-cli`
[on GitHub](https://github.com/OneVariable/poststation-util/blob/main/tools/poststation-cli/src/main.rs)
as a reference, as it uses the `poststation-sdk` crate as well.

## Talking with devices

There are generally two ways to interact with devices:

* When you DO NOT have a shared interface crate
* When you DO have a shared interface crate

It is possible with `postcard-rpc` to share the definition of types in a common crate between your
"host" application and firmware devices. These are often called "ICD", or ["Interface Control Document"]
crates.

The Poststation SDK offers methods where we do have these shared types, as well as methods that do not
require them. When we do not have these shared types, JSON is used as a message format, and messages are
checked at runtime for correctness. When we do have these shared types, then messages are sent directly
in binary `postcard` format.

If possible, it is recommended to have shared types. This is true in most cases, outside of cases where
a tool is expected to interface with many devices, or many versions of devices, for example an application
that is collecting log messages from all devices to forward to a log collection tool, like Loki or Prometheus.

The `poststation-cli` tool also operates without requiring these shared types, as it is intended to communicate
with any user device.

["Interface Control Document"]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_control_document

We'll start by covering the "without" case first.

### Without Shared Types

Since Poststation performs service discovery with all connected devices, it is possible to learn about
our connected simulator device without sharing types.

#### Getting logs

We can obtain text-based logs for our devices:

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Connect to the poststation server running locally.
    // defaults to secure connection settings
    let client = poststation_sdk::connect("127.0.0.1:51837").await.unwrap();

    // Obtain a list of connected devices, similar to
    // `poststation-cli ls`
    let devices = client.get_devices().await.unwrap();

    // Find our device. You will need to change the name here!
    let device_name = "QUIRKY-344";
    let mut serial = None;
    for device in devices.iter() {
        if device.name.contains(device_name) {
            serial = Some(device.serial);
            break;
        }
    }

    let Some(serial) = serial else {
        println!("Failed to find device '{device_name}'!");
        return;
    };

     // Get the most recent 3 logs from the device
    let Ok(response) = client.get_device_logs(serial, 3).await else {
        println!("Request failed!");
        return;
    };

    let Some(logs) = response else {
        println!("No device {serial:016X} found!");
        return;
    };

    // Print each log with a timestamp
    for log in logs {
        let time = log.uuidv7.id_to_time();
        let msg = log.msg;
        println!("{time}: '{msg}'");
    }
}
```

This will print something like this:

```sh
$ cargo run --release
   Compiling sdk-example v0.1.0 (/private/tmp/sdk-example)
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 0.96s
     Running `target/release/sdk-example`
2025-01-21 19:07:13.689 +01:00: I hope you have a nice day
2025-01-21 19:07:14.688 +01:00: I hope you have a nice day
2025-01-21 19:07:15.688 +01:00: I hope you have a nice day
```

#### Interacting with endpoints

We can get the schemas from our device, and ensure it is capable of the operations we are about to try:

```rust
let Ok(response) = client.get_device_schemas(serial).await else {
    println!("Request failed!");
    return;
};

let Some(schema) = response else {
    println!("No device {serial:016X} found!");
    return;
};

// Do we have the LED get and set endpoints?
//
// Note: you might want to verify the Key of these endpoints too, to ensure
// the types have not changed!
assert!(schema.endpoints.iter().any(|e| e.path == "simulator/status_led/set"));
assert!(schema.endpoints.iter().any(|e| e.path == "simulator/status_led/get"));

println!("OK :)");
```

Once we've verified this, we can try:

* Getting the value
* Inverting and setting the value
* Verifying the change has occurred

This could look something like this:

```rust
use serde_json::{Value, json};

let resp = client
    .proxy_endpoint_json(serial, "simulator/status_led/get", 1, Value::Null).await;

let Ok(response) = resp else {
    println!("Initial get failed!");
    return;
};

println!("Current state: '{response}'");

// Get each subfield, and invert the bits
let r = !response["r"].as_u64().unwrap() as u8;
let g = !response["g"].as_u64().unwrap() as u8;
let b = !response["b"].as_u64().unwrap() as u8;

// Set the new value
let new_value = json!({"r": r, "g": g, "b": b});
let resp = client
    .proxy_endpoint_json(serial, "simulator/status_led/set", 2, new_value.clone()).await;

let Ok(response) = resp else {
    println!("Set failed!");
    return;
};

assert_eq!(response, Value::Null);

let resp = client
    .proxy_endpoint_json(serial, "simulator/status_led/get", 1, Value::Null).await;

let Ok(response) = resp else {
    println!("Second Request failed!");
    return;
};

assert_eq!(response, new_value);
println!("Updated state: '{response}'");
```

Which should print something like this:

```sh
$ cargo run --release
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 0.04s
     Running `target/release/sdk-example`
Current state: '{"b":0,"g":0,"r":0}'
Updated state: '{"b":255,"g":255,"r":255}'
```
